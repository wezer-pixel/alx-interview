# Pascal's Triangle

This is a Python program that generates Pascal's Triangle.

## Description

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and each row is constructed by adding a 0 at the beginning and end, and then summing adjacent numbers from the previous row.

This program allows you to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.
